# odin-tic-tac-toe

This seemingly easy project was quite complex and even simplest features turned out to be quite tricky to implement with scale of the project growing. I successfully managed to avoid global variables but I still think the design decisions in terms of modules and the way they communicate could be vastly improved. All in all I started to appreciate factory functions and the module pattern a lot more.
 
In future projects I will definitely try to structure my code in a way that is more scalable and easier to maintain. Of course this sense of structure comes with practice so I hope one day when I finish a project I will not have a feeling that my code is complete spaghetti.
